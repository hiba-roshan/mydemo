database
Data transformation: where data are transformed or consolidated into forms
appropriate for mining by performing summary or aggregation operations
Data mining :an essential process where intelligent methods are applied in

Pattern evaluation to identify the truly interesting patterns representing
knowledge based on some interestingness measures
knowledge presentation: where visualization and knowledge representation
techniques are used to present the mined knowledge to the user.
